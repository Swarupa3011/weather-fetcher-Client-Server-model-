The Weather Fetcher is a simple client-server application where the client sends a city name to the server, and the server retrieves real-time weather information from an API. It then sends back details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions to the client. The project uses socket programming for communication, making it a basic yet practical example of network-based applications.
